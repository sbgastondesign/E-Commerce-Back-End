# E-Commerce-Back-End

Back end e-commerce that uses Express.js API and MySQL database

## Goal:

As the size and popularity of E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce grow, it is important to understanding the fundamental architecture of these platforms as a full-stack web developer.

When provided with an exisiting E-commerce platform, the goal was to test the database using Insomnia and apply the 'CRUD' principles (CREATE, READ, UPDATE and DELETE) to verify the usability and accuracy of the code.

## Results:

I was successful in using the seeds in MYSQL to properly execute the CRUD actions and test it in Insomnia. The screen shots below show examples using the 'products' from the e-commerce site.
